# 🖱️ Typing Speed Test – Java Console Application

A simple Java-based console application to **test typing speed and accuracy**. This project measures the **Words Per Minute (WPM)** and compares typed input against a reference sentence to evaluate **typing performance**.

---

## 🔧 Features
- 📝 Random sentence prompt for each test  
- ⏱️ Measures **typing time in milliseconds**  
- 🔢 Calculates **Words Per Minute (WPM)**  
- ✅ Displays **typing accuracy (%)** based on word and character comparison  
- 💻 User-friendly CLI interface with clear prompts and instructions

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Java (Swing for GUI)
- MySQL
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

---

## 📸 Sample Output

```bash
Type the following sentence:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

Your input: The quick brown fox jumps over the lzay dog

Time Taken: 18.9 seconds
Words Per Minute (WPM): 28.5
Accuracy: 91%
```
----
## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Create a new Java project in your IDE  
2. Add the contents of the `App.java` file to your `src` folder  
3. Configure JDBC connection with your MySQL database  
4. Compile and run the project
